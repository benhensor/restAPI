# restAPI
A repository for learning and practicing to work wth NodeJS, Express and MongoDB to build rest API's.

I started learning this in week 9 of the School of Code Bootcamp. In addition to the repositories we were given for our group workshops, I decided to create this one too in order to practice working with these new concepts in my spare time.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependencies.
